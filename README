 * =============== *

gpufield is a small CUDA C program for calculating magnetic fields around
direct current electromagnets.

gpufield reads a pretty terse yet flexible scripting language that allows the
user to define coil geometries in 3D space, and then take 2D slices of the
resulting magnetic fields. It's pretty quick and dirty, but useful enough
for designing coil geometries for earth's field NMR spectroscopy (EFNMR).

As an example, the following gpufield script computes the magnetic field around
an 'infinitely' long wire:

   current 1
   moveto 0 0 -1e6
   lineto 0 0 1e6
   moveto 0 0 0
   file 'field.dat'
   grid z 1 1 256 256
   clear
   end

The resulting file 'field.dat' will contain nine columns of data:

   i x y z Bx By Bz |B|

where the indices 'i' and 'j' will run from 0 to 255, 'x' and 'y' will run
from -0.5 to 0.5, and 'z' will equal 0. The components of the magnetic field
will be stored in 'Bx', 'By' and 'Bz', and the magnitude of the field will be
stored in '|B|'. (This is just a simple example, of course)

 | INSPIRATION FOR GPUFIELD: |
 * ========================= *

The gpufield program was spawned out of my search for a faster way to compute
magnetic fields of direct current electromagnets than from the magnetic
scalar potential. Finally, I ran across this paper:

   Rashdi Shah Ahmad, Amiruddin Bin Shaari, Chew Teong Han, "Magnetic Field
   Simulation of Golay Coil", Journal of Fundamental Sciences, 2008.

After seeing how much faster and simpler the computations could be, I had to
write my own program. However, there's really no reason to burn CPU cycles on
such an embarrassingly parallel problem, so I hooked into the NVIDIA CUDA API
to accelerate the computations.
